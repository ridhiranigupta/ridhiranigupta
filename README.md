About me
--------
I build production-grade systems and machine learning solutions that solve real problems at scale. I care deeply about clean engineering, performance, and product-minded decisions that move metrics. I enjoy bridging research and production — shipping models, reliable infra, and delightful UX for complex domains.

What I bring
------------
- System design & backend engineering: distributed systems, event-driven pipelines, APIs, low-latency services.
- Machine Learning & MLOps: model development, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and reproducible pipelines.
- Cloud & Infrastructure: designing secure, scalable stacks on modern cloud providers and container orchestration.
- Product-first thinking: focusing on outcomes, instrumentation, A/B evaluation, and continuous improvement.
- Cross-functional collaboration: working closely with PMs, designers, and researchers to deliver impact.

Why hire me
-----------
If your team values rigorous engineering, measurable product impact, and shipping end-to-end solutions that scale — we should talk. I'm excited to bring the blend of systems, ML, and product focus needed to build next-generation products at Google, Microsoft, Oracle, SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, or any ambitious team pushing technical boundaries.

Availability
------------
Open to full-time engineering roles and collaborative research-engineering positions. Willing to relocate for the right opportunity.

Footer
------
Made with care. Minimal, focused, and production-minded — just like the systems I build.
