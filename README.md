  Minimal • Elegant • Girly profile README
  Replace placeholders (email, linkedin, projects, resume) with your real links.
  I attempted to fetch your repositories to auto-fill projects but couldn't access them from the API in this session — add your top repos below or tell me which ones and I'll update this for you.

About me
--------
Hello! I'm a maker who loves turning thoughtful ideas into delightful, reliable software. I blend clean engineering, thoughtful design, and product curiosity to build tools and experiments that people actually enjoy using. I care about clarity, performance, and polish — and I like everything neat, pastel, and purposeful. 🌸

What I do
---------
- Build web and backend systems that are elegant and robust.
- Create reproducible ML workflows and data pipelines.
- Design delightful UX touches and accessible interfaces.
- Ship end-to-end projects — from idea to production-ready code.

Featured projects
-----------------
(Please replace each placeholder with the repo link or tell me which of your repos to feature and I'll fill them in.)

- Blossom — a minimal recipe & shopping planner with pretty animations and simple syncing.  
  Link: https://github.com/your-username/blossom
- Aurora — an end-to-end experiment with ML inference, retraining, and a small dashboard.  
  Link: https://github.com/your-username/aurora
- LivelyStream — a lightweight real-time processing demo with cute UI micro-interactions.  
  Link: https://github.com/your-username/livelystream

If you'd like, paste 3–6 repo names or links and I'll automatically create attractive project cards with short descriptions, tech tags, and screenshots.

Portfolio & contact
-------------------
- Resume — [resume.pdf](./resume.pdf) (drop your resume in the repo root)
- Email — you@yourdomain.com
- LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin
- Website — https://your-portfolio.example

Live GitHub summary

</p>

Aesthetic & small animated touches
----------------------------------
- The header uses a typing animation to feel warm and personal.
- Use pastel PNG/SVG screenshots for each project — rounded corners look lovely.
- Small GIFs or short Lottie loops are welcome in Featured projects to show interactions.

How to personalize quickly
--------------------------
1. Replace the typing-svg text (header) with your preferred title or tagline.  
2. Replace the placeholder project links with your real repo links and short 1-line descriptions.  
3. Add a resume.pdf to the repo root.  
4. Optional: add 300×180 PNG screenshots inside /assets/projects/ and I'll update the project cards to show them.

Why you'll like this README
---------------------------
It's minimal, feminine, and professional — a soft palette with purposeful content so visitors (and recruiters) see your strengths at a glance: projects, skills, and how to contact you.

Made with care 💖 — if you want, I can:
- Auto-fill the Featured projects with your actual repos (paste links or allow repo access), or
- Replace the GitHub stats theme and colors to match a specific pastel palette you prefer.
```
